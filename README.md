# 📰 Fake News Detection Using NLP & Machine Learning
# 🎓 Final Year Project (BS Software Engineering)
IQRA National University, Peshawar
# 📌 Project Description

The Fake News Detection Using NLP & Machine Learning project is an AI-based web application developed as a Final Year Project (FYP). The system automatically analyzes news headlines or short articles and classifies them as REAL or FAKE using machine learning techniques.

With the increasing spread of misinformation on digital platforms, this project aims to provide a fast, reliable, and user-friendly solution to help users verify the authenticity of news content.

# 🎯 Objectives

To detect fake news using supervised machine learning

To apply NLP techniques for text preprocessing and feature extraction

To provide real-time news classification through a web interface

To help users make informed decisions about online content                  

# 🧠 System Features

Binary fake news classification (REAL / FAKE)

NLP preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, text cleaning)
